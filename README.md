# PotHole-Detection
Intelligent pothole detection system using micro-controllers to provide real-time services.


# Introduction
Poor road conditions are becoming a severe hazard for the common people of India. In India, road-related conditions are a factor in 22,000 of the 42,000 traffic fatalities each year, majorly during night or during monsoon season. To address this issue, we tried to detect these potholes using micro-controller sensors which are, otherwise difficult to identify. This project done on a smaller scale, has the capability of vast scaling, provided ample time and resources.
This prototype is under the Safety & Security, Transportation and Governance classes of Smart City.
